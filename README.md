## **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (LTS version) - [Download Here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MySQL** (Installed Locally or via Docker) - [Download Here](https://www.mysql.com/)
- **Git** (For version control) - [Download Here](https://git-scm.com/)

## **Project Setup**

### **1. Clone the Repository**

Pull the latest code from GitHub:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:CSYE6225CloudSpring2025/webapp.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd webapp
```

### **2. Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file inside the project root and add the following:

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=healthcheck
```

Replace `yourpassword` with your actual MySQL password.

### **3. Install Dependencies**

Run the following command to install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### **4. Setup the Database**

- Start MySQL service (if not running):
  ```bash
  sudo service mysql start  # Linux/macOS
  brew services start mysql  # macOS (Homebrew)
  ```
- Manually create the database if it does not exist:
  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE healthcheck;
  ```

---

## **Running the Application**

Start the application with:

```bash
npm start
```

Expected output:

```
Server running on http://localhost:8080
Database initialized.
```

---

## **Testing the API**

### **1. Health Check Endpoint**

Run the following `curl` commands to test the API:

#### **‚úÖ Successful Check (200 OK)**

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/healthz -v
```

Expected response:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

#### **‚ùå Database Failure (503 Service Unavailable)**

Stop MySQL and test again:

```bash
sudo service mysql stop
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/healthz -v
```

Expected response:

```
HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
```

Restart MySQL and re-test:

```bash
sudo service mysql start
```

#### **‚ùå Invalid Method (405 Method Not Allowed)**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/healthz -v
```

Expected response:

```
HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
```

---

## **Pulling Updates from GitHub**

If you need to update your local repository with the latest code changes:

```bash
# Fetch the latest updates
git pull origin main
```

If you are on a different branch and want to switch to the latest version:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

---

## **Database Verification (SQL Queries)**

To manually verify database entries, connect to MySQL:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

Run the following SQL query to check inserted health records:

```sql
USE healthcheck;
SELECT * FROM HealthChecks;
```

Expected Output:

```
+---------+---------------------+
| CheckId | datetime            |
+---------+---------------------+
| 1       | 2025-01-29 12:45:00 |
| 2       | 2025-01-29 12:46:00 |
+---------+---------------------+
```

---

## **Stopping the Application**

To stop the running server:

```bash
CTRL + C
```

To stop MySQL (if needed):

```bash
sudo service mysql stop
```

---

## **Conclusion**

You have successfully set up and tested the **Health Check API**. üöÄ If you encounter issues, review the logs or check database connectivity. Happy coding!
